# RoyalTransportTaxiService

We need to establish our goals and priorities.


1. add gizmo to allow one to summon the royalty permit for transport shuttle
2. make it not require any royalty titles
3. Make it required Allied faction status for the <faction>Empire</faction> from the xml file
4. Make it cost 500 silver?? where would the silver come from.. maybe search all map tiles for which one has silver in range of a trade beacon
